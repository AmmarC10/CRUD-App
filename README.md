# CRUD-App
A simple CRUD application made using React.js, Node.js, and MySQL.
This application allows you to insert an item's name, entry date, and cost into a MySQL database, update an items cost, and delete an item. 
A MySQL schema is already created with a table called "items" with the rows name, date, and cost
There is less emphasis on the front end of the application as I wanted to work and practice on back end development using Node.js and Express.js.
