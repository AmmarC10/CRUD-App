# CRUD-App
A simple CRUD application made using React.js, Node.js, and MySQL.
This application allows you to insert an item's name, entry date, and cost into a MySQL database, update an items cost, and delete an item.
Right now the database is connected to my own but, it can be changed to fit any. 
There is less emphasis on the front end of the application as I wanted to work and practice on back end development using Node.js and Express.js
